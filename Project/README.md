# Smart Solar Panel System
Smart Solar Panel System is an automation in generating energy from the renewable source which is Solar Light in more efficient way with the reduction of cost and space of implementation. Solar panel absorbs the energy from the Sun, converts it into electrical energy and stores the energy in a battery. The position of the Sun with respect to the solar panel is not fixed due to the rotation of the Earth. For an efficient usage of the solar energy, the Solar panels should absorb energy to a maximum extent. So this project aims to collect the maximum energy from the sun.
